# SQL Task (Hacker Rank)
My first SQL project. I attempted 20 SQL tasks,  which earned me 3 stars on the competitive tech platform, Hacker Rank. 
This task made me confident with using SQL for data cleaning, data manipulation, data extraction and data analysis, even though I prefer using Python now.
